Task 3.1 — Extract title, meta description, and forms
1. Inspect forms: are there login forms? hidden fields? suspicious parameters?
    No

2. Note title and meta descriptions — are they meaningful?
    scanme.nmap.org: Title "Go ahead and ScanMe!" indicates this is a test/educational environment meant for scanning practice

    example.com: Title "Example Domain" indicates this is a demonstration site

    httpbin.org: Title "httpbin.org" matches the service purpose

Task 3.2 — Keyword scanning in page text

   $ python3 lab4-1_parse.py http://scanme.nmap.org/
        "keyword_counts": {
            "admin": 0,
            "login": 0,
            "debug": 0,
            "error": 0

    $ python3 lab4-1_parse.py http://example.com/    
        "keyword_counts": {
            "admin": 0,
            "login": 0,
            "debug": 0,
            "error": 0
    
    $ python3 lab4-1_parse.py http://httpbin.org/
         "keyword_counts": {
            "admin": 0,
            "login": 0,
            "debug": 0,
            "error": 0

    This means they are very secure and no sensitive terms are visible     
    $ python3 lab4-1_parse.py http://testphp.vulnweb.com   
        "keyword_counts": {
            "admin": 0,
            "login": 0,
            "debug": 0,
            "error": 1

        This means the page could be displaying an error message to users or it might have help text about error handling or might actually experiencing a minor error
